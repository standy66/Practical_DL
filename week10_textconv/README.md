## Practice

This week's practice is just as usual: jump to the notebook and follow instructions from there.

__This notebook is also a part of homework assignment__, you may have noticed there's the same exact notebook there.

There's also more versions in theano and tensorflow hiding under ./other_frameworks, including
* 1d convolutions for prohibited content filtering
* 1d convolutions for music processing
